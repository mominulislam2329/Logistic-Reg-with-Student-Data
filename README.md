## Logistic Regression for Categorical Data

-	Understand and compare logistic regression model and Tree based model.
-	Using the fictitious SDSU Student data, we have compared tree based model and logistic regression model.
-	Used Summary statistics and exploratory data analysis for categorical and continuous data in our SDSU student data set.
-	In logistic regression response is a categorical variable with two levels. We code them with 1 or 0. In case of mathematical modeling, we model the probability of one level.
-	A logistic regression model using glm() with Graduated as dependent (target) variable and HSGPA and ACT as independent (predictor) variables.
-	A tree model using rpart() with Graduated as dependent (target) variable and HSGPA and ACT as independent (predictor) variables.
-	Lastly, we compared our two models based on results that we got.
